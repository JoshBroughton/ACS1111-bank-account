# Bank Account Project

An object-oriented bank account project written in Python. Includes a bank account
class with typical attributes and methods such as the name of the account owner,
an account number, balance, and methods to deposit, withdraw, and get the balance of
the account. Adheres to PEP 8 Style Guide, with some help from the Pylint extension.
